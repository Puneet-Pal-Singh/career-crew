**MEGA-CONTEXT PROMPT FOR CAREERCREWCONSULTING.COM DEVELOPMENT**

Hello! I'm continuing the development of a job portal project named `careerCrewConsulting.com`. This prompt contains all the necessary background, specifications, progress so far, and the immediate next steps. Your role is to assist me in completing the MVP and potentially future phases.

**I. PROJECT OVERVIEW & INITIAL SPECIFICATION ("THE BIG PROMPT")**

The goal is to build a general-purpose job portal with a modern SaaS look (inspired by Vercel/Linear).

**Below is the original full specification document I started with:**

[START OF ORIGINAL "BIG PROMPT" SPECIFICATION]

**Updating project prompt**

Below is your fully updated “big prompt” specification. It incorporates the complete PRD, UI/UX flows, design guidelines, implementation roadmap (MVP → V1 → V2), and the latest tech‑stack table (local vs. cloud). You can feed this entire block to an LLM to scaffold, code, and deploy your job‑portal end‑to‑end.

---

## Summary

You will build a general‑purpose job portal with four roles (Job Seeker, Employer, Admin, Referrer), light/dark toggle, and a polished SaaS look inspired by Vercel/Linear. The stack uses Next.js + Tailwind on the front end, Node.js (TypeScript) + Prisma + PostgreSQL on the back end, in‑house JWT auth, local Docker for dev, Supabase‑hosted Postgres for production, and Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring. The MVP ships in 2–3 days on free tiers; V1 and V2 phases add messaging, analytics, profiles, AI matching.

## 6. Big Prompt for LLM (Original - for context on initial scaffolding idea)

```text
You are to scaffold a full job‑portal web application from scratch, following this specification:
1. PRD: Public, general‑purpose job portal with roles: Job Seeker, Employer, Admin, Referrer. MVP: Landing with Light/Dark toggle, Jobs Listing (filters), Job Detail → Apply modal, Employer Dashboard (submit/status), Admin Dashboard (approve/edit/reject). V1: messaging, bookmarks, analytics. V2: resume builder, profiles, referral payouts, AI matching.
2. Tech Stack: Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS. Backend: Node.js (TypeScript) + Prisma + PostgreSQL (Supabase free‑tier). Auth: in‑house JWT (bcrypt, HTTP‑only cookies, rate limiting). Local dev: Docker Compose (app, Postgres). Cloud: Vercel for Next.js & serverless APIs; Supabase Postgres. CI/CD: GitHub Actions + Vercel integration.
3. UI/UX Flow & Design: Site map and screen flows as specified. Light/Dark toggle in header; responsive mobile‑first design. Color tokens, typography, component rules, micro‑animations per guidelines.
4. Data Schema: users(id, role, name, email, phone, linkedin, resume_url, password_hash). jobs(id, employer_id, title, description, location, remote, salary, status, created_at). applications(id, job_id, seeker_id, resume_data, status, applied_at). referrals(id, referrer_id, candidate_email, job_id, status, credit, referred_at).
5. Implementation: Next.js app folder structure with pages, components, lib/supabaseClient.ts (now prismaClient). Docker Compose file for local services. Prisma schema and migration scripts. JWT auth middleware for API routes. GitHub Actions workflows for lint/test/migrate/deploy. Vercel config (vercel.json).
6. Testing: Cypress tests for search filters, apply flow, dashboards. Unit tests via Jest/Vitest for auth and API logic. (Testing not yet implemented).
Generate the complete file structure, code, config, Docker files, CI scripts, and deployment settings in a GitHub repo layout. Ensure all environment variables, secrets, and migration steps are documented.
```

[END OF ORIGINAL "BIG PROMPT" SPECIFICATION]
---

**II. KEY DECISIONS / DEVIATIONS FROM INITIAL SPEC:**

*   **bcrypt vs bcryptjs:** Switched from native `bcrypt` to `bcryptjs` due to persistent Docker build/architecture issues with the native module. All auth utils and API routes use `bcryptjs`.
*   **Fonts:** Using `Inter` for body and `GeistSans` for display text, configured via `next/font` and `geist/font` respectively, applied using CSS variables in `tailwind.config.js` and `src/app/layout.tsx`.
*   **Docker Compose Syntax:** Using `docker compose` (no hyphen) as per modern Docker CLI.
*   **Strict TypeScript:** Avoiding `any` types where possible.

---

**III. PROGRESS SO FAR (ACHIEVEMENTS):**

**A. Phase 0: Setup & Foundations**
*   **Version Control:** Git repo initialized, GitHub connected, `.gitignore` configured.
*   **Project Initialization:** Next.js 15.x (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier configured with scripts (`lint`, `format`).
*   **Docker Environment:**
    *   Refactored `Dockerfile` with multi-stage builds (base, deps, builder, runner, development) using `node:23-alpine`. Production image size significantly reduced (~241MB). `next.config.mjs` updated with `output: 'standalone'`. `.dockerignore` in place.
    *   `docker-compose.yml` configured for `app` (Next.js) and `db` (Postgres 15-alpine) services, custom network, persistent DB volume. Port `5555` exposed on `app` for Prisma Studio.
*   **Database (Prisma):**
    *   Prisma installed, initialized. `src/lib/prisma.ts` for singleton client.
    *   `prisma/schema.prisma` defined for `User`, `Job`, `Application` models and `UserRole`, `JobStatus`, `ApplicationStatus` enums. (Referrer model deferred).
    *   Initial migration created and applied.
*   **Design Foundation:**
    *   Target aesthetic: Vercel/Linear.
    *   Basic color palette, typography defined in `tailwind.config.js`.
*   **Basic CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
    *   `.github/workflows/ci.yml` created for lint, typecheck, and build on push/PR to main/develop.

**B. Phase 1: Core Authentication**
*   **Backend (In-house JWT with `bcryptjs` & `jsonwebtoken`):**
    *   Dependencies: `bcryptjs`, `jsonwebtoken`, `jose` (for middleware), and their types.
    *   JWT config (`JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`) in `.env`.
    *   Password utilities (`src/lib/authUtils.ts`): `hashPassword`, `comparePassword` using `bcryptjs`.
    *   API Route: `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` (POST handler with input validation, existing user check, password hashing, user creation via Prisma).
    *   API Route: `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (POST handler with validation, user lookup, password comparison, JWT generation, JWT set in HTTP-Only cookie on `NextResponse`).
    *   Authentication Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`): Uses `jose` for JWT verification from cookie, basic public/protected path logic, redirects to `/login`, matcher configured.
*   **Frontend (Client Components):**
    *   Reusable `AuthForm` component (`src/components/auth/AuthForm.tsx`): Handles form state, submission to API endpoints, loading/error/success messages, optional redirects. Uses a client-side `ClientUserRole` enum mirror to avoid issues with importing Prisma enums directly in client components.
    *   Login Page (`src/app/login/page.tsx`): Uses `AuthForm` in 'login' mode.
    *   Registration Page (`src/app/register/page.tsx`): Uses `AuthForm` in 'register' mode.
    *   API routes tested with Postman and cURL; frontend forms tested.

**C. Core Layout & UI (Partial Implementation)**
*   **Root Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`):**
    *   Configured with `Inter` and `GeistSans` fonts using CSS variables.
    *   Basic structure with placeholders for `Header`, `Footer`, and `ThemeProvider`.
    *   `suppressHydrationWarning` added to `<html>`.
*   **Tailwind Configuration (`tailwind.config.js`):**
    *   `darkMode: 'class'`.
    *   `fontFamily` extended for `sans` (Inter, Geist Sans) and `display` (Geist Sans).
    *   Custom color palette defined (background, surface, primary, secondary, content, subtle).
*   **Global Styles (`src/globals.css`):**
    *   Standard `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`.
    *   Basic resets and global font application using CSS variables.
*   **Layout Components:**
    *   `Header` component (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`): Basic structure, logo, static nav links ("Browse Jobs"), placeholder Login/Signup links.
    *   `Footer` component (`src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`): Basic copyright notice.
*   **Theme Toggle:**
    *   `next-themes` installed.
    *   `ThemeProvider` wrapper (`src/components/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`).
    *   `ThemeToggleButton` (`src/components/theme/ThemeToggleButton.tsx`) created and added to Header. Theme toggle is functional.

**IV. CURRENT STATUS / LAST TASK WORKED ON:**

*   The last major step was successfully implementing and testing the **frontend authentication pages (Login, Register)** and the **core application layout (Header, Footer, Theme Toggle)**.
*   We were just about to fully implement the **Landing Page UI (`src/app/page.tsx`)** based on the design concepts and PRD (Hero, Features, Recent Jobs sections). A basic structure for this page was drafted.

```

---

**VI. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS / WHAT'S LEFT FOR MVP (To be done with new chat):**

1.  **Complete Landing Page UI (`src/app/page.tsx`):**
    *   Fully style the Hero, Features, and Recent Jobs sections according to the Vercel/Linear aesthetic using the defined Tailwind theme.
    *   Integrate icons into the Features section.
    *   Create a reusable `JobCard.tsx` component for displaying individual jobs in the "Recent Job Listings" section and later on the main Jobs Listing page.
    *   Create and connect to an API endpoint (`/api/jobs/recent`) to fetch and display actual recent jobs (initially can be placeholder data from API, then connect to Prisma).
2.  **Implement Conditional Header Navigation:** Update `Header.tsx` to show/hide "Post a Job" and "Dashboard" links based on user authentication status and role. Display user email/name and a Logout button if logged in.
3.  **Jobs Listing Page:** Implement the full page as per the plan.
4.  **Job Detail Page & Apply Modal:** Implement as per the plan.
5.  **Employer Dashboard:** Implement as per the plan.
6.  **Admin Dashboard:** Implement as per the plan.
7.  **Polish, Test, and Deploy MVP.**

---

**VII. INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW CHAT:**

Your primary role is to assist in completing the MVP of the `careerCrewConsulting.com` job portal. We have just completed the foundational setup, authentication (backend & frontend), and core UI layout (Header, Footer, Theme Toggle).

**The immediate next task is to fully implement the UI for the Landing Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)**, including styling the existing sections (Hero, Features, Recent Jobs), creating a `JobCard` component, and then setting up an API to fetch recent jobs.

Please maintain the "production grade from day 1" philosophy, adhere to TypeScript best practices (avoid `any` where possible), use `docker compose` syntax, and keep the Vercel/Linear design aesthetic in mind.

Let's start by focusing on refining the `src/app/page.tsx` with proper styling and creating the `JobCard` component.
