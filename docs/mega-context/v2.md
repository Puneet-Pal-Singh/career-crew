Okay, I understand perfectly. We need to create a "Mega-Context Prompt v2" that encapsulates everything for a new chat instance, allowing it to pick up seamlessly where we're leaving off, especially given your token constraints.

This will be a very detailed snapshot. I will structure it to be as clear and comprehensive as possible for the new LLM.

Here's the comprehensive prompt. Please copy the entire content from "--- START OF MEGA-CONTEXT PROMPT V2 ---" to "--- END OF MEGA-CONTEXT PROMPT V2 ---" into your new chat instance.

**--- START OF MEGA-CONTEXT PROMPT V2 ---**

Hello! I am continuing the development of a job portal project named `careerCrewConsulting.com`. This prompt contains all the necessary background, original specifications, detailed progress so far (including features, file structures, and key decisions), an updated implementation plan, and the immediate next steps. Your role is to assist me in completing the MVP with a new design direction and then moving on to other features.

**I. ORIGINAL PROJECT OVERVIEW & "THE BIG PROMPT" SPECIFICATION**

The initial goal was to build a general-purpose job portal with a modern SaaS look (inspired by Vercel/Linear), defaulting to a dark mode. *Note: We have recently decided to pivot the design to a light mode default with a more colorful, pleasing aesthetic, but the core functionalities remain largely the same.*

**Below is the original full specification document ("The Big Prompt") I started with. It's crucial for understanding the foundational requirements, even if some visual aspects will change:**

[START OF ORIGINAL "BIG PROMPT" SPECIFICATION - VERBATIM]

**Updating project prompt**

Below is your fully updated “big prompt” specification. It incorporates the complete PRD, UI/UX flows, design guidelines, implementation roadmap (MVP → V1 → V2), and the latest tech‑stack table (local vs. cloud). You can feed this entire block to an LLM to scaffold, code, and deploy your job‑portal end‑to‑end.

---

## Summary

You will build a general‑purpose job portal with four roles (Job Seeker, Employer, Admin, Referrer), light/dark toggle, and a polished SaaS look inspired by Vercel/Linear. The stack uses Next.js + Tailwind on the front end, Node.js (TypeScript) + Prisma + PostgreSQL on the back end, in‑house JWT auth, local Docker for dev, Supabase‑hosted Postgres for production, and Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring. The MVP ships in 2–3 days on free tiers; V1 and V2 phases add messaging, analytics, profiles, AI matching.

**II. KEY DECISIONS & DEVIATIONS (From Original Spec During Development)**

*   **`bcryptjs`:** Switched from native `bcrypt` to `bcryptjs` due to Docker build issues.
*   **Fonts:** Confirmed `Inter` for body and `GeistSans` for display text, configured via `next/font` and `geist/font` using CSS variables.
*   **Docker Compose Syntax:** Using `docker compose` (no hyphen).
*   **Strict TypeScript:** Aiming to avoid `any` types.
*   **Tailwind CSS Version:** Initially started with v4, encountered some setup issues (especially with Turbopack and PostCSS config), then **downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3** for stability. `tailwind.config.ts` (using ES module syntax) and `postcss.config.mjs` are configured for v3.
*   **Turbopack:** Temporarily disabled (`next dev` instead of `next dev --turbopack`) to resolve Tailwind/PostCSS build issues. Can be re-evaluated later.
*   **Client Component Serialization:** Encountered and resolved errors related to passing non-serializable props (like icon components) from Server Components to Client Components by passing icon names (strings) instead.

**III. NEW DESIGN DIRECTION (SUPERSEDING Original Visual Guidelines)**

*   **Default Mode:** Light mode will be the default.
*   **Aesthetic:** Minimal, modern, colorful, and pleasing to a broad audience. Aim for a welcoming and professional feel.
*   **Color Palette (Implemented in `tailwind.config.ts`):**
    *   **Light Mode:**
        *   `background-light`: `#F9FAFB` (Very Light Gray)
        *   `surface-light`: `#FFFFFF` (White for cards)
        *   `content-light`: `#1A2B42` (Deep Navy/Charcoal)
        *   `subtle-light`: `#5A6B82` (Muted Gray-Blue)
        *   `primary`: `#2A6FFF` (Vibrant Blue)
        *   `secondary`: `#FF8C2A` (Warm Orange)
        *   `accent1`: `#2AE8FF` (Bright Cyan/Aqua)
        *   `border-light`: `#E5E7EB`
    *   **Dark Mode (Revised):**
        *   `background-dark`: `#1A202C` (Cool Dark Gray/Navy)
        *   `surface-dark`: `#2D3748` (Slightly Lighter Dark Gray/Navy)
        *   `content-dark`: `#E2E8F0` (Light Gray)
        *   `subtle-dark`: `#A0AEC0` (Medium Gray)
        *   `primary-dark`: `#5A9FFF` (Lighter Blue)
        *   `secondary-dark`: `#FFA75A` (Lighter Orange)
        *   `accent1-dark`: `#5AF0FF` (Lighter Cyan)
        *   `border-dark`: `#4A5568`
*   **Header:** Transparent on initial load, becoming solid (with backdrop blur) on scroll.
*   **Animations:** Subtle text/element animations using Framer Motion. Dynamic background animations (e.g., "aurora" or "cosmic mesh" style for Hero).
*   **Gradients:** To be used for backgrounds and accents to add visual appeal.

**IV. PROGRESS SO FAR (ACHIEVEMENTS & FILE STRUCTURE)**

**A. Phase 0: Setup & Foundations (Largely DONE)**
*   **Version Control:** Git repo, GitHub, `.gitignore`.
*   **Project Initialization:** Next.js (App Router, v13/14 likely, current screenshot showed 15.3.1 stale for Turbopack but we're on stable Next.js for dev now), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (v3).
*   **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier.
*   **Docker Environment:**
    *   `Dockerfile` (multi-stage builds, `node:23-alpine` was used, `output: 'standalone'`).
    *   `docker-compose.yml` for `app` and `db` (Postgres 15-alpine), custom network, volume. Prisma Studio on `5555`.
*   **Database (Prisma):**
    *   `src/lib/prisma.ts` (singleton client).
    *   `prisma/schema.prisma` (User, Job, Application models; UserRole, JobStatus, ApplicationStatus enums).
    *   Initial migration created and applied.
*   **Basic CI/CD (GitHub Actions):** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint, typecheck, build).

**B. Phase 1: Core Authentication (Largely DONE)**
*   **Backend (JWT with `bcryptjs`, `jsonwebtoken`, `jose`):**
    *   `.env` for `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`.
    *   `src/lib/authUtils.ts`: `hashPassword`, `comparePassword`.
    *   API Routes:
        *   `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` (POST).
        *   `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` (POST, sets HTTP-Only cookie).
    *   Middleware: `src/middleware.ts` (JWT verification via `jose`, path protection).
*   **Frontend (Client Components):**
    *   `src/components/auth/AuthForm.tsx` (reusable for login/register).
    *   `src/app/login/page.tsx`.
    *   `src/app/register/page.tsx`.

**C. Core Layout & UI (Partially Done, Reflecting New Design)**
*   **Root Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`):**
    *   Inter and GeistSans fonts via CSS variables.
    *   `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes` (`src/components/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`).
    *   Basic structure for Header, main, Footer.
*   **Tailwind Config (`tailwind.config.ts`):**
    *   `darkMode: 'class'`.
    *   New colorful palette (as detailed in Section III).
    *   Font families extended.
*   **Global Styles (`src/globals.css`):**
    *   Tailwind base, components, utilities.
    *   Base styles for `html`, `body`, `a` reflecting the new light mode default and color palette.
*   **Layout Components:**
    *   `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`: Implemented with scroll-triggered transparency/solid background, mobile menu, logo, basic nav links, `ThemeToggleButton`.
    *   `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`: Basic placeholder.
*   **Theme Toggle:**
    *   `src/components/theme/ThemeToggleButton.tsx`: Functional sun/moon toggle.

**D. Landing Page (`src/app/page.tsx` - Server Component, using Client Components for animated sections)**
*   **Hero Section:**
    *   Implemented as a Client Component: `src/components/landing/AnimatedHeroSection.tsx`.
    *   Uses `src/components/ui/AnimatedGradientBackground.tsx` (current "aurora" style) for a dynamic background. This component is functional.
    *   Content (H1, P, CTAs) uses Framer Motion for animations.
    *   Styled to be full viewport height.
*   **"How It Works" Section:**
    *   Implemented as a Client Component: `src/components/landing/AnimatedHowItWorksSection.tsx`.
    *   Uses `src/components/landing/HowItWorksStep.tsx` (presentational) for individual steps.
    *   Icon names (strings) are passed as props, icons rendered in the client component.
    *   Framer Motion for section and item animations.
*   **"Features" Section:**
    *   Currently static JSX in `page.tsx`. Uses `src/components/landing/FeatureItem.tsx` (presentational). (Planned for animation).
*   **"Featured Companies" Section:**
    *   Currently static JSX in `page.tsx`. Uses `src/components/landing/FeaturedCompanyLogo.tsx` (presentational). Placeholder logos used.
*   **"Testimonials" Section:**
    *   Implemented as a Client Component: `src/components/landing/AnimatedTestimonialsSection.tsx`.
    *   Uses `src/components/landing/TestimonialCard.tsx` (presentational).
    *   Placeholder AI-generated avatars and company names/logos planned.
    *   Framer Motion for section and card animations.
*   **"Recent Jobs" Section:**
    *   Currently static JSX in `page.tsx`, fetches data via `getRecentJobs()`.
    *   Uses `src/components/jobs/JobCard.tsx` (presentational).
    *   Mock API: `src/app/api/jobs/recent/route.ts` provides placeholder job data.
*   **"Final CTA" Section:**
    *   Implemented as a Client Component: `src/components/landing/AnimatedFinalCTASection.tsx`.
    *   Features a vibrant gradient background and Framer Motion animations.
*   **Other Components Created:**
    *   `src/components/ui/Badge.tsx`
    *   `src/types/index.ts` defines `JobCardData`.

**V. CURRENT STATUS / LAST TASK WORKED ON**

*   Successfully implemented the "aurora" style `AnimatedGradientBackground.tsx` for the Hero section, making it fill the viewport height.
*   Refactored several landing page sections (`Hero`, `HowItWorks`, `Testimonials`, `FinalCTA`) into their own Client Components to handle Framer Motion animations and client-side logic correctly, resolving serialization issues.
*   The current look of the landing page (light mode default) is taking shape, with dynamic backgrounds and initial animations in place for key sections.
*   The immediate next step discussed was to potentially switch the Hero background to a "Cosmic Mesh" style, further polish the Header, add more sections to the landing page, and enhance placeholders.

**VI. UPDATED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (MARKDOWN - MVP FOCUS)**

```markdown
# Career Crew Consulting - Implementation Plan (MVP - New Design)

**VII. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (To be done with new chat instance)**

1.  **Finalize Hero Section Background:** Implement the "Cosmic Mesh" background animation (`CosmicMeshBackground.tsx`) as an alternative/improvement to the current "aurora" style, ensuring it fills the full viewport height of the Hero section.
2.  **Polish Header (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`):**
    *   Ensure logo and nav link text colors have perfect contrast and readability in both transparent (top) and scrolled (solid/blurred background) states, for both light and dark modes.
    *   Refine mobile menu appearance and functionality if needed.
    *   Implement conditional rendering of "Login/Sign Up" vs. "Dashboard/Post Job/Logout" links based on authentication state (this will require integrating with an auth context/hook later, for now, we can plan the UI).
3.  **Complete Remaining Landing Page Sections (as per updated plan):**
    *   Refactor "Features" section into `AnimatedFeaturesSection.tsx` with Framer Motion.
    *   Implement "Stats/Numbers" section with `StatItem.tsx` (animated numbers) and `AnimatedStatsSection.tsx`.
    *   Enhance "Featured Companies" with better placeholders/logos.
    *   Implement "Blog Preview" section with `BlogPreviewCard.tsx` and `AnimatedBlogPreviewSection.tsx` (potentially mock blog data API).
    *   Design and implement "For Job Seekers" and "For Employers" detailed benefit sections.
4.  **Implement Core Job Portal Functionality (Phase 3 of MVP plan):** Jobs Listing, Job Detail, Apply Modal, Employer Dashboard, Admin Dashboard. This involves creating many new pages, components, and API routes connecting to Prisma.

**VIII. FUTURE PLANS (Post-MVP)**

*   **V1 Enhancements:** Messaging/Chat, Job Bookmarks, Employer & User Analytics, Actual Resume Upload (not just data), Refine Dashboards.
*   **V2 & Beyond:** On-platform Resume Builder, Public User Profiles, Referrer Program (if kept), AI Resume-Job Matching, Mobile Wrapper.
*   **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana.

**IX. INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW CHAT (YOU)**

Your primary role is to assist me in:
1.  Finalizing the "wow factor" for the landing page, including the "Cosmic Mesh" background for the Hero, polishing the Header, and building out the remaining dynamic sections with Framer Motion animations.
2.  Subsequently, implementing the core job portal functionalities (job listings, details, application process, employer dashboard, admin dashboard).
3.  Adhere to the new design direction (light mode default, colorful, pleasing, modern) and the established tech stack.
4.  Prioritize clean, maintainable, and production-ready TypeScript code.
5.  Follow the pattern of using Server Components for data fetching and structure, and Client Components for interactivity and animations.

Let's start by focusing on the **"Cosmic Mesh" background for the Hero section** and **polishing the Header's appearance and responsiveness.**

**--- END OF MEGA-CONTEXT PROMPT V2 ---**

This prompt is significantly longer and more detailed. It should give the new chat instance a very solid understanding of the entire project lifecycle and current state. Good luck!
