## 1. Summary of Session

This chat session was characterized by deep dives into refining the visual polish of the landing page, followed by a series of significant and persistent infrastructure challenges related to Docker and Prisma. These challenges ultimately led to a strategic pivot to a Supabase-backed MVP to accelerate development and focus on user-facing features. We established a strong, visually engaging landing page and a clear, faster path forward for the MVP.

## 2. Key Challenges Faced & Solutions

This session was defined by overcoming several complex technical hurdles.

### 2.1. Landing Page Visuals & Layout

*   **Challenge:** The initial Hero section's Aurora gradient background was not covering the full viewport width, leaving white spaces on the sides.
*   **Solution:** Identified that the `<main>` tag in `src/app/layout.tsx` had `container mx-auto` classes, constraining all content. The fix was to make `<main>` full-width and apply `container mx-auto` classes *inside* each section that needed a constrained width, while leaving the `AnimatedHeroSection` to be full-bleed.

*   **Challenge:** The Header needed to be more polished and visually distinct, both at the top of the page (transparent state) and on scroll.
*   **Solution:** We iterated through several styles:
    1.  **"Island" Style:** Implemented a header that is transparent at the top and transitions to a semi-transparent, blurred "island" with a subtle border and shadow on scroll.
    2.  **Orange Gradient (Attempted):** Explored a version where the island had an orange gradient. This presented text contrast challenges.
    3.  **Final Refined Island:** Settled on the `surface-light/dark` background for the island, but refined its transparency, padding, and added a subtle text shadow to the logo/links when in the transparent state for better readability against the Hero's dynamic background.

*   **Challenge:** The Hero section's Aurora gradient disappeared or became a plain white hue at extreme aspect ratios (e.g., 20% browser zoom).
*   **Solution (Iterative):** This was a persistent and difficult issue.
    1.  **Attempt 1:** Increased orb sizes using `vmin`.
    2.  **Attempt 2:** Switched to `vmax` to ensure orbs scaled with the longer viewport edge.
    3.  **Attempt 3:** Switched to a `fixed` position background layer and `vw`/`vh` orb sizes.
    4.  **Attempt 4 (Aggressive Vibrancy):** Drastically reduced blur and increased opacity/solid color stops. This was deemed less visually appealing than a previous version.
    *   **Final Decision:** The issue proved to be a time-consuming edge case. The decision was made to **park this specific issue for now** to maintain MVP velocity, accepting that the background works well in all normal browsing conditions.

*   **Challenge:** The "Trusted by Leading Companies" logo marquee had a visible blank space at the end of its loop.
*   **Solution:** Refactored the `AnimatedFeaturedCompanies.tsx` component to use a `ref` to dynamically calculate the exact width of one set of logos. The Framer Motion animation was then configured to translate by exactly that width (`- (ref.current?.offsetWidth || 0)`), ensuring a perfectly seamless loop.

### 2.2. Prisma & Docker Infrastructure (The Major Pivot Point)

*   **Challenge:** Persistent `Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at db:5432` when running `npx prisma migrate dev` from the host machine.
*   **Solution:** This multi-step debug process revealed a classic Docker networking misunderstanding:
    1.  The Prisma CLI, running on the **host machine**, was trying to connect to the hostname `db`, which only exists *inside* the Docker network.
    2.  The fix was to configure two different `DATABASE_URL`s:
        *   **For the host (`.env` file):** Point to `localhost:5433` (the port mapped from the container to the host).
        *   **For the app container (`docker-compose.yml` `environment` section):** Point to `db:5432` (the internal Docker service name and port).

*   **Challenge:** `FATAL: ... No space left on device` error from the PostgreSQL container.
*   **Solution:** Identified this as a common Docker issue. The solution was to run `docker system prune -a --volumes` to clear out unused images, containers, and volumes that were consuming host disk space.

*   **Challenge:** `Error: @prisma/client did not initialize yet. Please run "prisma generate"...` runtime error in the Next.js app, even after running `generate` on the host.
*   **Solution:** Diagnosed the issue as the Prisma Client being generated in the wrong context or not being available to the running Docker container.
    1.  **Root Cause Identified:** The `output` path in `prisma/schema.prisma` was `output = "./node_modules/.prisma/client"`. Because the schema was in the `prisma/` directory, this caused Prisma to generate the client into an incorrect nested directory: `prisma/node_modules/`.
    2.  **Fix:** Corrected the path to `output = "../node_modules/.prisma/client"` to target the project's root `node_modules`.
    3.  **Dockerfile Enhancement:** Added `RUN npx prisma generate` to the `development` stage of the `Dockerfile` to ensure the client is always correctly generated within the image context *before* the app starts.

### 2.3. Strategic Pivot to Supabase

*   **Challenge:** The cumulative time and effort spent debugging Docker networking, Prisma client generation, and environment variable conflicts was significantly slowing down progress towards the MVP. The primary goal of a fast launch was being jeopardized by infrastructure complexity.
*   **Solution:** Made a strategic decision to **pivot the MVP backend to Supabase.**
    *   **Cleanup:** Created a new branch (`v1-dev-supabase-mvp`) and systematically removed Docker, Prisma, and custom auth files.
    *   **New Stack:** Adopted Supabase for Authentication, Database (PostgreSQL), and potentially Storage. The backend logic will be handled by Next.js API Routes/Server Actions interacting with the Supabase client.
    *   **Development Workflow:** Shifted from `docker compose up` to `npm run dev` for faster local iteration on the UI and core features.

## 3. Features Added & Enhanced (Landing Page)

Despite the challenges, significant progress was made on creating a visually rich and dynamic landing page.

*   **Refactored `page.tsx`:** The main landing page was refactored from a large monolithic file into a clean component structure, where `page.tsx` primarily handles data fetching and composes section components.
*   **Data Layer:** Data definitions and fetching logic for landing page content were centralized in `src/lib/data/`.
*   **"How It Works" Section:** Enhanced with animated connector lines that "draw" as each step animates into view, plus subtle hover effects on the icons.
*   **"Features" Section:** Re-designed from a simple grid into a more dynamic, alternating layout (text left/visual right, and vice-versa) with Framer Motion animations.
*   **"Stats/Numbers" Section (New):**
    *   A high-impact section with a vibrant gradient background (`primary` to `secondary`).
    *   Features animated counters that spring into value as the section scrolls into view.
    *   Iterated on the design to achieve good contrast and visibility for icons and text (e.g., black text on gradient).
*   **"Testimonials" Section:**
    *   Enhanced `TestimonialCard` design for a more premium feel.
    *   Added a distinct section background and subtle, slow-moving parallax "blob" shapes for visual depth.
    *   Improved card hover animations.
*   **"Recent Jobs" Section:**
    *   Enhanced `JobCard` design with better information hierarchy, icons, and tags.
    *   Made the section interactive with client-side filter buttons (All, Full-time, Remote, etc.).
    *   Added staggered entrance animations for the job cards.
*   **"For Job Seekers" & "For Employers" Sections (New):**
    *   Created two new, detailed sections with targeted messaging for each user group.
    *   Implemented responsive two-column layouts that stack correctly on mobile.
    *   Used themed accent colors and subtle background gradients to visually distinguish them.
*   **Blog Preview Section (New):**
    *   Designed and implemented a section to display recent blog posts.
    *   Created a polished `BlogPreviewCard` component with a feature image, category badge, and hover effects.

## 4. What's Left for the Future / Post-MVP

*   **Hero Background Edge Case:** The issue with the Aurora gradient's coverage at extreme aspect ratios (e.g., <30% zoom) is parked. A simpler static gradient or image could be a fallback if this becomes a priority.
*   **"For Employers" Gradient:** The subtle orange gradient was not rendering due to a persistent CSS issue. This is a minor visual polish that is parked for now.
*   **In-House Backend:** The entire original plan of using a custom Dockerized backend with Prisma and JWT auth is now a **post-MVP goal**. This will be a great project to build in parallel for resume/skill demonstration once the Supabase-powered MVP is launched and validated.

## 5. Next Steps (for New Chat)

The next chat will pick up on the `v1-dev-supabase-mvp` branch with the following immediate goals:

1.  **Implement Supabase Authentication:**
    *   Create an `AuthContext` for client-side session management.
    *   Refactor the login and registration pages/forms to use the `supabase-js` client.
    *   Update `middleware.ts` for route protection using Supabase server-side helpers.
2.  **Set up Database Schema in Supabase:**
    *   Manually create the `profiles` (or `users`), `jobs`, and `applications` tables in the Supabase Dashboard.
    *   Establish foreign key relationships.
    *   Implement basic Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
3.  **Begin Building Core Dashboard Functionality** using Supabase for all data interactions.
