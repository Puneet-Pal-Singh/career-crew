# Project Log: Chat Session #7

**Date:** August 4, 2025
**Objective:** Fix critical production bugs, complete core MVP features, and perform final polish.

## Synopsis

This was one of the most intensive and productive sessions for the CareerCrew project. We began with a deployed but critically broken MVP. The primary user flows (sign-up and login) were failing in subtle but catastrophic ways. Through a deep, systematic, and often frustrating debugging process, we identified and resolved several interconnected bugs related to authentication, data synchronization, and middleware.

With the application stabilized, we successfully implemented the last major piece of core functionality: the "Forgot Password" flow. Finally, we performed several key MVP polishing tasks, including UI enhancements and fixing broken links. The project is now in a stable, feature-complete state for its MVP launch.

## Part I: The Saga of the Production Bugs

This section documents the primary challenge of our session: debugging a live, failing system.

### The Initial Problems:

1.  **Broken Sign-Up:** Users signing up as an 'EMPLOYER' were being created as a 'JOB_SEEKER'.
2.  **Broken "Apply Now" Button:** The button was not working as intended.
3.  **Infinite Redirect Loop:** Logging in with certain users caused an infinite loop on the `/dashboard` page.
4.  **Stale Data:** The behavior was inconsistent between newly created users (who worked correctly) and older test users (who failed).

### The Debugging Journey & Key Breakthroughs:

Our debugging process was a multi-stage investigation that peeled back layers of the problem.

1.  **Initial Theory (Incorrect): Misconfigured URLs.** We first suspected `localhost` URLs were being used in production. This was quickly ruled out.

2.  **Second Theory (Incorrect): Middleware Race Condition.** We hypothesized that the middleware was interfering with the `/auth/callback` route. While we made some changes, this wasn't the root cause.

3.  **Third Theory (Partially Correct): Flawed `auth/callback` Logic.** We discovered that for Google OAuth, the `intended_role` was not being correctly saved to the user's JWT metadata, which was a significant issue.

4.  **Fourth Theory (The Real Root Cause): The Database Trigger.** The ultimate breakthrough came when we analyzed the `handle_new_user` SQL function. We discovered it was hardcoding every new user's role to `JOB_SEEKER`, completely ignoring the metadata being passed by our application. **Fixing the SQL trigger was the most critical fix of the entire session.**

5.  **Final Discovery (The Loop's Cause): Data Desynchronization.** Even after fixing the trigger, old users still caused a redirect loop. We proved that this was due to **data desynchronization**:
    *   The user's **JWT** (read by the middleware) said `{ "onboarding_complete": true }`.
    *   The user's **database profile** (read by the dashboard page) said `{ "has_completed_onboarding": false }`.
    *   This created a "fight" where the dashboard would redirect to onboarding, and the middleware would redirect back to the dashboard, ad infinitum.

### The Definitive Solution:

The final, stable solution involved two parts:

*   **Fixing the Data:** We concluded that the old users' data was corrupt and the only safe action was to **delete them** and test with fresh accounts.
*   **Fortifying the Code:** We made the `/dashboard/page.tsx` component resilient. It now explicitly checks for data desynchronization between the JWT and the database. If it detects a mismatch, it safely signs the user out instead of starting a loop.

## Part II: New Feature Implementation

With the application stable, we built the last core feature for the MVP.

### Feature: "Forgot Password" Flow

We built the entire end-to-end "Forgot Password" feature.

*   **UI Scaffolding:** Created the `/forgot-password` and `/update-password` pages and their corresponding form components (`ForgotPasswordForm.tsx`, `UpdatePasswordForm.tsx`).
*   **Server Actions:** Implemented `forgotPasswordAction.ts` (which securely calls Supabase to send the reset email) and `updatePasswordAction.ts` (which securely updates the user's password).
*   **Supabase Configuration:** Correctly configured the Supabase "Reset Password" email template to redirect users to our `/update-password` page.
*   **Complex Bug Fixing:** We debugged and solved a subtle server-side vs. client-side race condition on the `/update-password` page. The final solution involved removing the premature server-side check and implementing a client-side "loading shell" in the form component to gracefully handle the session from the URL hash.
*   **UI Polish:** We performed a full UI revamp of both forms to match the professional quality of the inspiration designs from Dribbble, including improved success states and UX.

## Part III: MVP Polish & Housekeeping

We completed the final set of tasks to bring the MVP to a professional standard.

*   **Terms of Service Page:** We created a placeholder page at `/terms` to fix the `404 Not Found` error from the footer link. We also updated the `ClientLayout.tsx` to hide the main header on this page.
*   **Auth Page Performance:** We significantly improved the load times of the `/login` and `/signup` pages by removing redundant server-side session checks, making them fast-loading static pages.
*   **Code Quality:**
    *   We analyzed and acted on several suggestions from the **CodeRabbit** automated review tool, improving state management and error handling.
    *   We deleted the obsolete `AuthForm.tsx` file, which was causing build failures and was a remnant of an old architecture.
*   **Git Workflow:** We had a detailed discussion about professional Git practices, including the trade-offs between "Merge Commit," "Rebase," and "Squash," and the correct local workflow using `git fetch` and `git merge`.

## Part IV: The Roadmap (Future Work)

### Immediate Next Steps:

The application is now functionally complete and stable. The next priorities are to focus on the high-impact, public-facing user experience.

1.  **Landing Page Revamp:** A full overhaul of the landing page to create a professional, compelling, and SEO-rich first impression.
2.  **Job Details Page UI:** A full UI revamp of the job details page to improve readability and encourage users to apply.

### Post-MVP / V2 Features:

The long-term vision remains the same. Features we have left for the future include:

*   Saved Jobs / Bookmarking for Seekers.
*   Employer Dashboard V2: Applicant Viewing & Management.
*   Full Company Profiles.
*   Advanced Search & Filtering.
*   User Profile Management / Settings Page.
*   Email Notifications.
